# MultiSSH
**MultiSSH** is a lightweight, versatile shell script tool designed to execute commands across multiple SSH servers simultaneously. Whether you're managing server configurations or performing bulk operations, MultiSSH provides an efficient, minimalistic solution with minimal dependencies.

## Description
MultiSSH is a simple yet powerful shell script, crafted to streamline the management of multiple SSH servers. It allows users to execute commands on numerous servers at once, making it ideal for tasks such as system administration, server configuration, or automating large-scale maintenance routines.

With its lightweight nature and lack of complex dependencies, MultiSSH integrates seamlessly into existing workflows, providing quick setup and usage. This makes it particularly useful for DevOps teams, network administrators, and anyone working in environments with extensive server infrastructures.

Key features include the ability to activate/deactivate specific groups or individual servers, check server statuses, and execute commands both synchronously and asynchronously, offering users full control over their server operations.

Key Benefits:

    Execute commands across multiple servers in parallel.
    Activate or deactivate entire groups of servers or individual servers.
    Check the real-time status of SSH connections and server health.
    Minimal dependencies, making it easy to deploy and use in any shell environment.
    Ideal for large infrastructures, allowing bulk server operations and automation.

Ideal Use Cases:

    DevOps teams managing large server fleets.
    System administrators handling configuration or routine maintenance tasks.
    Automation scripts for server health checks, updates, or batch operations.

## Installation
Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/Murtrag/MultiSSH.git

Make the setup script executable:

chmod +x setup.sh

Run the setup script:

./setup.sh

This script will:

    Copy the repository to /home/$USER/MultiSSH
    Create a symlink for the multiSSH.sh script in /usr/local/bin/, so you can use the command multissh from anywhere.
    Add execution permissions to the multiSSH.sh script.

Distro packages: Coming soon.

## Usage
**MultiSSH** can be used in two modes: **standard command-line mode** and **interactive mode**.
### Command-Line Mode:

You can run the program as a regular command by providing a list of servers and the command to be executed. Below is the syntax for usage:
```
Usage: ./multissh [-nsv] [-f FILE] COMMAND
Executes COMMAND as a single command on every server.
  -f FILE  Use FILE for the list of servers. Default: ${SERVER_LIST}.
  -n       Dry run mode. Display the COMMAND that would have been executed and exit.
  -s       Execute the COMMAND using sudo on the remote server.
  -v       Verbose mode. Displays the server name before executing COMMAND.
  -i       Interactive mode
```
- -f FILE: Specifies the file that contains the list of servers to use. By default, it reads from a predefined list ${SERVER_LIST}.
- -n: Runs the script in dry-run mode, where the commands are shown but not executed.
- -s: Executes the command with sudo on the remote server.
- -v: Enables verbose mode, showing the server name before executing the command.
- -i: Starts the program in interactive mode.
### Interactive Mode:

In interactive mode, you can run commands dynamically to manage groups of servers. The available commands are:
```
!gs or !groups          - Display available groups.
!g or !group [GROUP]    - Display available servers in the specified group or in the active group if none is provided.
!a or !activate [RESOURCE]   - Activate the specified resources (group or server).
!da or !deactivate [RESOURCE] - Deactivate the specified resources (group or server).
!s or !status           - Display the status of the active group of servers, including SSH status and connection status.
exit                    - Exit the session and disconnect from active SSH servers.

!e or !execute          - Execute a Linux command on active SSH servers and display the output in the shell.
!ea or !execute-async   - Execute a Linux command asynchronously on active SSH servers and display the output in the shell.
!h or !help [COMMAND]   - Get general help or specific help for a command.
clear                   - Clear the terminal screen.
```
### How to Use the Shell:

- **Check Available Groups**  
  To start, you may want to list all available server groups. Use the following command to see which groups are available:
  ```bash
  !gs
  ```

- **Display Servers in a Group**  
  If you want to see which servers belong to a specific group, use the command:
  ```bash
  !g group_name
  ```
  If you donâ€™t specify a group, it will show servers in the currently active group:
  ```bash
  !g
  ```

- **Activate Servers**  
  To activate all servers in a particular group, use the `!a` command followed by the group name:
  ```bash
  !a group_name
  ```
  You can also activate multiple groups at once:
  ```bash
  !a group1,group2
  ```
  Additionally, if you want to activate only a specific server (blade) within a group, use the format:
  ```bash
  !a group_name:server_name
  ```

- **Deactivate Servers**  
  Similarly, to deactivate servers in a group, use the `!da` command followed by the group name:
  ```bash
  !da group_name
  ```
  To deactivate multiple groups:
  ```bash
  !da group1,group2
  ```
  You can also deactivate a specific server within a group:
  ```bash
  !da group_name:server_name
  ```

- **Check Status of Servers**  
  To check the status of active servers (whether SSH is running and if they are connected), use:
  ```bash
  !s
  ```

- **Execute Commands on Active Servers**  
  To run a Linux command synchronously on all active servers and view the output in the shell:
  ```bash
  !e command
  ```
  For example:
  ```bash
  !e ls /var
  ```

- **Run Commands Asynchronously**  
  If you need to run a long-running command asynchronously (in the background) on active servers, use:
  ```bash
  !ea command
  ```

- **Exit the Shell**  
  When you're done, exit the interactive mode and disconnect from all active SSH sessions with:
  ```bash
  exit
  ```

- **Get Help**  
  If you need general help or help with a specific command, use:
  ```bash
  !h
  !h command_name
  ```

- **Clear the Terminal Screen**  
  To clear the terminal window:
  ```bash
  clear
  ```

**Example Workflow:**

1. Start by displaying available groups with `!gs`.
2. Activate multiple groups with `!a group1,group2`.
3. Check the status of all active servers with `!s`.
4. Run a Linux command across the active servers with `!e ls /var`.
5. Deactivate specific servers with `!da group2`.
6. Exit the interactive mode with `exit`.

This shell allows you to easily manage server groups, run commands, and monitor server statuses in an intuitive way.

## Configuration

## Running Tests
For testing, the project uses **shunit2** as the testing framework.

In the root directory, there is a script named **`./test.sh`**, which can be run to execute the entire test suite:

```bash
./test.sh
```
You can also specify a particular group of tests to run by providing the group name as an argument:
```
./test.sh <group>
```
This flexibility allows for running specific test cases or groups of tests when needed.
