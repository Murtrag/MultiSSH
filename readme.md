## Installation

To install **MultiSSH**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Murtrag/MultiSSH.git
   ```

2. **Make the setup script executable:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ```

3. **Run the setup script:**

   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   This script will:
   - Install the dependencies: rlwrap, tmux, and sshpass.
   - Copy the repository to `/home/$USER/MultiSSH`.
   - Create a symlink for the `multiSSH.sh` script in `/usr/local/bin/`, allowing you to use the command `multissh` from anywhere.
   - Add execution permissions to the `multiSSH.sh` script.
   - Create a temporary file at /tmp/multissh/current_resource.tmp to store currently active resources.

**Distro packages:** Coming soon.

## Usage
**MultiSSH** can be used in two modes: **standard command-line mode** and **interactive mode**.
### Command-Line Mode:

You can run the program as a regular command by providing a list of servers and the command to be executed. Below is the syntax for usage:
```
Usage: ./multissh [-nsv] [-f FILE] COMMAND
Executes COMMAND as a single command on every server.
  -f FILE  Use FILE for the list of servers. Default: ${SERVER_LIST}.
  -n       Dry run mode. Display the COMMAND that would have been executed and exit.
  -s       Execute the COMMAND using sudo on the remote server.
  -v       Verbose mode. Displays the server name before executing COMMAND.
  -i       Interactive mode
```
- -f FILE: Specifies the file that contains the list of servers to use. By default, it reads from a predefined list ${SERVER_LIST}.
- -n: Runs the script in dry-run mode, where the commands are shown but not executed.
- -s: Executes the command with sudo on the remote server.
- -v: Enables verbose mode, showing the server name before executing the command.
- -i: Starts the program in interactive mode.
### Interactive Mode:

In interactive mode, you can run commands dynamically to manage groups of servers. The available commands are:
```
!gs or !groups          - Display available groups.
!g or !group [GROUP]    - Display available servers in the specified group or in the active group if none is provided.
!a or !activate [RESOURCE]   - Activate the specified resources (group or server).
!da or !deactivate [RESOURCE] - Deactivate the specified resources (group or server).
!s or !status           - Display the status of the active group of servers, including SSH status and connection status.
exit                    - Exit the session and disconnect from active SSH servers.

!e or !execute          - Execute a Linux command on active SSH servers and display the output in the shell.
!ea or !execute-async   - Execute a Linux command asynchronously on active SSH servers and display the output in the shell.
!h or !help [COMMAND]   - Get general help or specific help for a command.
clear                   - Clear the terminal screen.
```
### How to Use the Shell:

- **Check Available Groups**  
  To start, you may want to list all available server groups. Use the following command to see which groups are available:
  ```bash
  !gs
  ```

- **Display Servers in a Group**  
  If you want to see which servers belong to a specific group, use the command:
  ```bash
  !g group_name
  ```
  If you donâ€™t specify a group, it will show servers in the currently active group:
  ```bash
  !g
  ```

- **Activate Servers**  
  To activate all servers in a particular group, use the `!a` command followed by the group name:
  ```bash
  !a group_name
  ```
  You can also activate multiple groups at once:
  ```bash
  !a group1,group2
  ```
  Additionally, if you want to activate only a specific server (blade) within a group, use the format:
  ```bash
  !a group_name:server_name
  ```

- **Deactivate Servers**  
  Similarly, to deactivate servers in a group, use the `!da` command followed by the group name:
  ```bash
  !da group_name
  ```
  To deactivate multiple groups:
  ```bash
  !da group1,group2
  ```
  You can also deactivate a specific server within a group:
  ```bash
  !da group_name:server_name
  ```

- **Check Status of Servers**  
  To check the status of active servers (whether SSH is running and if they are connected), use:
  ```bash
  !s
  ```

- **Execute Commands on Active Servers**  
  To run a Linux command synchronously on all active servers and view the output in the shell:
  ```bash
  !e command
  ```
  For example:
  ```bash
  !e ls /var
  ```

- **Run Commands Asynchronously**  
  If you need to run a long-running command asynchronously (in the background) on active servers, use:
  ```bash
  !ea command
  ```

- **Exit the Shell**  
  When you're done, exit the interactive mode and disconnect from all active SSH sessions with:
  ```bash
  exit
  ```

- **Get Help**  
  If you need general help or help with a specific command, use:
  ```bash
  !h
  !h command_name
  ```

- **Clear the Terminal Screen**  
  To clear the terminal window:
  ```bash
  clear
  ```

**Example Workflow:**

1. Start by displaying available groups with `!gs`.
2. Activate multiple groups with `!a group1,group2`.
3. Check the status of all active servers with `!s`.
4. Run a Linux command across the active servers with `!e ls /var`.
5. Deactivate specific servers with `!da group2`.
6. Exit the interactive mode with `exit`.

This shell allows you to easily manage server groups, run commands, and monitor server statuses in an intuitive way.

## Configuration

### Global Settings

The configuration for the MultiSSH script can be adjusted in the file located at `/home/$USER/multissh/global.sh`. You can edit this file using:

```bash
nano /home/$USER/multissh/global.sh
```

This file contains global settings for SSH connections, such as default user, password, port, and identity file.

**Example configuration in `global.sh`:**

```bash
# SSH Auth config
DEFAULT_USER="vagrant"

# To use default password, the package sshpass is required
# DEFAULT_PASSWORD="password123"

DEFAULT_PORT="22"

# DEFAULT_IDENTITY="-i /home/vagrant/.ssh/my_vagrant_key"

DEFAULT_EXTRA="-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no"
```

- **DEFAULT_USER**: The default SSH user to be used if not specified for a particular server.
- **DEFAULT_PASSWORD**: The default SSH password (if sshpass is installed) for servers that don't require an SSH key.
- **DEFAULT_PORT**: The default SSH port if no specific port is provided.
- **DEFAULT_IDENTITY**: The path to the SSH private key file to be used for authentication.
- **DEFAULT_EXTRA**: Additional SSH options, such as disabling strict host key checking.

These global variables set default values for SSH connections, and they will be used unless specific details are provided in the imported data.

### Importing Server Groups and Servers

You can import a list of server groups and their respective servers using the MultiSSH command with the `-f` option, like this:

```bash
multissh -f /path/to/file.txt
```

**Format of the File:**

The format of the file must follow these rules:

- **Group Name**: Defined by a line starting with `#`, e.g., `#HomeServers`.
- **Server Details**: For each group, you can specify servers under the group name. Each server entry should contain:
  - IP address (required)
  - Server name (required, enclosed in parentheses)
  - User (optional, will default to `DEFAULT_USER` if not specified)
  - Port (optional, will default to `DEFAULT_PORT` if not specified)

**Example file format:**

```
#HomeServers
127.0.5.1 (blade1)
127.0.5.2 (blade2)
127.0.5.3 (blade3)

#WorkServers
127.0.6.1 (blade1)
127.0.6.2 (blade2)
127.0.6.3 (blade3)
```

Each entry can optionally specify the user and port, for example:

```
user@127.0.5.1:2222 (blade1)
```

In this case:

- **User**: Overrides the default user for this specific server.
- **Port**: Overrides the default port for this specific server.

If no user or port is provided, the global defaults from `global.sh` will be used.

## Running Tests
For testing, the project uses **shunit2** as the testing framework.

In the root directory, there is a script named **`./test.sh`**, which can be run to execute the entire test suite:

```bash
./test.sh
```
You can also specify a particular group of tests to run by providing the group name as an argument:
```
./test.sh <group>
```
This flexibility allows for running specific test cases or groups of tests when needed.
